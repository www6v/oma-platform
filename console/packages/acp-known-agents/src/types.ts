/**
 * Core interfaces for spawning and driving an ACP-compatible agent.
 *
 * Three layers, intentionally separated so the same agent-driving code
 * (`AcpRuntime`) works whether the agent is a local subprocess (clash-bridge
 * use case) or running inside an openma sandbox container (openma session
 * use case).
 *
 *   [Spawner]            How a child process gets started + its stdio.
 *                        Different per host: Node child_process for local,
 *                        openma sandbox.exec for cloud.
 *
 *   [ChildHandle]        The opaque process — read stdout, write stdin,
 *                        wait for exit, kill. AcpRuntime never inspects
 *                        process identity, just speaks JSON-RPC over the
 *                        streams.
 *
 *   [AcpRuntime]         Wraps a ChildHandle in @agentclientprotocol/sdk's
 *                        ClientSideConnection. Owns the conversation:
 *                        new session → prompt → stream events → close.
 *
 * The split also keeps the SDK dependency out of the spawner contracts —
 * a host can ship a Spawner without pulling in the ACP protocol layer.
